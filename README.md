Alternate Racial Traits:
- Half-elf: ancestral arms,
- Half-orc: toothy, sacred tattoo.
 
Other features:
- Everyone can select a Deity (optional),
- Everyone can select 2 traits at character creation (optional),
- Archetype stacking.


 
It also add following feats:
- Additional Traits (if traits are enabled),
- Favored Prestige Class (due to technical reasons should always be taken before taking first level in corresponding prestige class)
- Prestigious Spellcaster (again due to technical reasons can be taken only after you select a spellbook to advance with corresponding prestige class,
also it will not work if it is taken for spontaneous caster advancing prestige class and you get to select new spells known from some other spontaneous casting class,
i.e. if you have eldritch knight advancing sorcerer spellcasting, you can not take the feat during a level up for let's say inquisitor class)

It requires at least Call of the Wild 1.102.

This mod supposed to work with all classes that were introduced by other mods as long as it is loaded the last (should be by default).

For other modders: you can easily add favored class bonuses for your races/classes by providing a simple description file and placing it in /ZFavoredClass/Custom/,
 (there is already an example), you will need to specify:
- guid of the feature corresponding to the favored class bonus (ensure that it has enough ranks, do not use existing features, but rather create a copy of them, since blueprint will be altered)
- how many levels are needed to acquire the feature
- guid of the feature giving partial bonus (if there is any, otherwise leave it empty)
- guid of the class (due to guid generation process, if you want to use same bonus for different classes, you will need to supply full and partial features with different guids for each class)
- guid of races providing this favored class bonus
